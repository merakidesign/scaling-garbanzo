# scaling-garbanzo

This is a temporary repository for the new redesign of the MerakiDesigns homepage.

There already exists a repository for the current homepage, and a v2 branch for the new design. The v2 branch was started on top of the old Sanity starter but abandoned to start the redesign from scratch. Scaling Garbanzo is a funny enough code name for the repo.
